## Description

This cookbook provides numerous security-related configurations, providing all-round base protection.

It configures:

 * Configures package management e.g. allows only signed packages
 * Remove packages with known issues
 * Configures `pam` and `pam_limits` module
 * Shadow password suite configuration
 * Configures system path permissions
 * Disable core dumps via soft limits
 * Restrict Root Logins to System Console
 * Set SUIDs
 * Configures kernel parameters via sysctl

It will not:

 * Update system packages
 * Install security patches

## Requirements

* Opscode chef
* Cookbooks:
  * Opscode sysctl `https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/sysctl`
  * Opscode apt `https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apt.git`
  * Opscode yum `https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum.git`

**Note for `sysctl` usage:**

We deprecated `sysctl` version before `0.6.0`. Future versions of this cookbook will depend on version 0.6.0 and greater. If you are going to use version 0.6.0, use `sysctl::apply` instead of `sysctl::default` in your runlist to ensure the configuration change will be applied.

*Optional*: you can use [berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) to install dependencies.

## Attributes

* `['os-hardening']['desktop']['enable'] = false`
  true if this is a desktop system, ie Xorg, KDE/GNOME/Unity/etc
* `['os-hardening']['network']['forwarding'] = false`
  true if this system requires packet forwarding (eg Router), false otherwise
* `['os-hardening']['network']['ipv6']['enable'] = false`
* `['os-hardening']['network']['arp']['restricted'] = true`
  true if you want the behavior of announcing and replying to ARP to be restricted, false otherwise
* `['os-hardening']['env']['extra_user_paths'] = []`
  add additional paths to the user's `PATH` variable (default is empty).
* `['os-hardening']['env']['umask'] = "027"`
* `['os-hardening']['env']['root_path'] = "/"`
  where root is mounted
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['pw_max_age'] = 60`
  maximum password age
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['pw_min_age'] = 7`
  minimum password age (before allowing any other password change)
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['retries'] = 5`
  the maximum number of authentication attempts, before the account is locked for some time
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['lockout_time'] = 600`
  time in seconds that needs to pass, if the account was locked due to too many failed authentication attempts
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['timeout'] = 60`
  authentication timeout in seconds, so login will exit if this time passes
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['allow_homeless'] = false`
  true if to allow users without home to login
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['pam']['passwdqc']['enable'] = true`
  true if you want to use strong password checking in PAM using passwdqc
* `['os-hardening']['auth']['pam']['passwdqc']['options'] = "min=disabled,disabled,16,12,8"`
  set to any option line (as a string) that you want to pass to passwdqc
* `['os-hardening']['security']['users']['allow'] = []`
  list of things, that a user is allowed to do. May contain: `change_user`
* `['os-hardening']['security']['kernel']['enable_module_loading'] = true`
  true if you want to allowed to change kernel modules once the system is running (eg `modprobe`, `rmmod`)
* `['os-hardening']['security']['kernel']['enable_sysrq'] = false`
* `['os-hardening']['security']['kernel']['enable_core_dump'] = false`
* `['os-hardening']['security']['suid_sgid']['enforce'] = true`
  true if you want to reduce SUID/SGID bits. There is already a list of items which are searched for configured, but you can also add your own
* `['os-hardening']['security']['suid_sgid']['blacklist'] = []`
  a list of paths which should have their SUID/SGID bits removed
* `['os-hardening']['security']['suid_sgid']['whitelist'] = []`
  a list of paths which should not have their SUID/SGID bits altered
* `['os-hardening']['security']['suid_sgid']['remove_from_unknown'] = false`
  true if you want to remove SUID/SGID bits from any file, that is not explicitly configured in a `blacklist`. This will make every Chef run search through the mounted filesystems looking for SUID/SGID bits that are not configured in the default and user blacklist. If it finds an SUID/SGID bit, it will be removed, unless this file is in your `whitelist`.
* `['os-hardening']['security']['suid_sgid']['dry_run_on_unknown'] = false`
  like `remove_from_unknown` above, only that SUID/SGID bits aren't removed.
  It will still search the filesystems to look for SUID/SGID bits but it will only print them in your log. This option is only ever recommended, when you first configure `remove_from_unknown` for SUID/SGID bits, so that you can see the files that are being changed and make adjustments to your `whitelist` and `blacklist`.
* `['os-hardening']['security']['packages']['clean'] = true`
  removes packages with known issues.
* `['os-hardening']['security']['packages']['list'] = ['xinetd','inetd','ypserv','telnet-server','rsh-server']`
  list of packages to remove, by default we remove the following packages:
  * xinetd ([NSA](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf), Chapter 3.2.1)
  * inetd ([NSA](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf), Chapter 3.2.1)
  * tftp-server ([NSA](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf), Chapter 3.2.5)
  * ypserv ([NSA](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf), Chapter 3.2.4)
  * telnet-server ([NSA](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf), Chapter 3.2.2)
  * rsh-server ([NSA](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf), Chapter 3.2.3)

## Usage

Add the recipes to the `run_list`, it should be last:

    "recipe[os-hardening]"

Configure attributes:

    "security" : {
      "kernel" : {
        "enable_module_loading" : true
      }
    },

## Local Testing

For local testing you can use vagrant and Virtualbox of VMWare to run tests locally. You will have to install Virtualbox and Vagrant on your system. See [Vagrant Downloads](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) for a vagrant package suitable for your system. For all our tests we use `test-kitchen`. If you are not familiar with `test-kitchen` please have a look at [their guide](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started).

Next install test-kitchen:

    gem install test-kitchen kitchen-vagrant

Next install berkshelf for dependency management

    gem install berkshelf

Create a local kitchen configuration:

    cp .kitchen.local.yml{.example,}

You should now be able to run tests:

```bash
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install

# Do lint checks
bundle exec rake lint

# Fetch tests
bundle exec thor kitchen:fetch-remote-tests

# fast test on one machine
bundle exec kitchen test default-ubuntu-1204

# test on all machines
bundle exec kitchen test

# for development, it uses docker based vms
bundle exec kitchen create default-ubuntu-1204
bundle exec kitchen converge default-ubuntu-1204

# if you like to use the vagrant setup, use
KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.vagrant.yml bundle exec kitchen converge default-ubuntu-1404
```
